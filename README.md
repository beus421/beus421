I'm a web developer and freelancer with six months of professional experience, focused on building functional and innovative projects. I enjoy solving both creative and technical challenges to deliver effective and user-friendly solutions.

## What I Do

I work with a range of technologies, from front-end development to backend systems, also llm framworks. Here’s a quick overview::

- **Frontend Wizardry:**
 HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript – the holy trinity for smooth and responsive designs.

- **Dynamic Web Applications:**  
  WordPress & React – for those times when you need a website that’s as dynamic as your ideas.

- **Modern Frameworks:**  
  Next.js – because server-side rendering and fast performance are a must.

- **Backend Brilliance:**  
  FastAPI & Python – for building APIs that make data dance.

- **Automation & Testing:**  
  Playwright – ensuring that everything works just as it should (or so we hope).

- **AI & Beyond:**  
  Langchain, Python, and C++ – dabbling in building AI agents and exploring the cutting-edge of technology.

## Professional Journey

I've been a web developer for a year and a freelancer for the past two years. In that time, I've worked on a variety of projects, collaborated with great teams, and come to appreciate debugging as both a challenge and a skill.
