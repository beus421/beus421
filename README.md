## Who Am I?

I'm a web developer and freelancer with a passion for building innovative projects. With 6 months of professional experience and a knack for both creative and technical problem solving, I strive to keep things both fun and functional.

## What I Do

I specialize in a range of technologies, from crafting pixel-perfect frontends to building robust backend systems. Here's a quick rundown:

- **Frontend Wizardry:**  
  HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript â€“ the holy trinity for smooth and responsive designs.

- **Dynamic Web Applications:**  
  WordPress & React â€“ for those times when you need a website thatâ€™s as dynamic as your ideas.

- **Modern Frameworks:**  
  Next.js â€“ because server-side rendering and fast performance are a must.

- **Backend Brilliance:**  
  FastAPI & Python â€“ for building APIs that make data dance.

- **Automation & Testing:**  
  Playwright â€“ ensuring that everything works just as it should (or so we hope).

- **AI & Beyond:**  
  Langchain, Python, and C++ â€“ dabbling in building AI agents and exploring the cutting-edge of technology.

## Professional Journey

I've been honing my craft as a web developer and freelancer for the past 6 months. During this time, I've contributed to exciting projects, collaborated with awesome people, and learned that debugging sometimes feels like a form of art.

## My Hobbies

When I'm not busy coding or chasing the next big project, you'll find me:

- Pumping iron at the gym  
- Binging the latest anime  
- Gaming like there's no tomorrow
